
A program that can perform addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations on two 4-bit operand inputs. Used Quartus and VHDL to create the program and verified it using ModelSim. This program was uploaded to an FPGA board where the switches would be inputs and the output would display on the 7-segment displays and LEDs. This program also utilizes flipflops to act as registers so the inputs can be stored.
